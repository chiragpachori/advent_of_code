## Goals:

- [x] Zero imports
- [x] Within 24 hours

## Thoughts:

1. Just looking at the question and example in AoC website reminded me of the diagram for - Select r from n 
possibilities with replacement (specifically how it was explained in Stat 110 by Prof Joe Blitzstein). But I don't think
that can be used to solve this in any way
2. Having an unconventional path to Data Science has made me too reliant on pandas dataframes and similar tools. My 
first thought for this problem was read_txt as dataframes and stuff ü§¶üèª‚Äç. I soon realized that approach is too complicated
and is a massive overkill
3. What I ended up doing was implementing a solution with 0 imports and I think that should be one of my goals for this
challenge
4. I should figure out how to add a checklist to the README file in every question directory
